See `.planning/research/grade4-curriculum.md` for detailed standard-by-standard breakdown.

### 2. New York State Standards (NYSLS)

Closely follows Common Core with minor additions:
- Emphasis on mathematical practices (problem-solving, reasoning)
- Additional focus on estimation strategies
- Stronger emphasis on real-world applications
- Uses "Next Generation Mathematics Learning Standards" (2017 revision)

### 3. Russian Mathematical Tradition

**Source:** Research papers, Russian School of Math (RSM) curriculum outlines

**Key Differences from US:**
- **Earlier abstraction:** Variables and unknowns introduced in Grade 1 (vs Grade 3-4 in US)
- **Stronger mental math:** Emphasis on computing without writing, number decomposition
- **Logical reasoning:** Pattern recognition, logic puzzles, sequences from age 6
- **Word problems:** More complex multi-step problems at earlier ages
- **Geometry emphasis:** Spatial reasoning, symmetry, transformations earlier

**Grade-level mapping (approximate):**
| Grade | Russian Focus | US Equivalent |
|-------|--------------|---------------|
| 1 | Add/sub to 20, unknowns (□ + 3 = 7), patterns | Grade 1-2 US |
| 2 | Add/sub to 100, multiplication intro, measurement | Grade 2-3 US |
| 3 | Multiplication tables, division, fractions intro, multi-step problems | Grade 3-4 US |
| 4 | Multi-digit multiplication, long division, decimal fractions, algebraic reasoning | Grade 4-5 US |

### 4. Singapore Math

**Source:** MOE Singapore syllabus, research papers

**Key Approach:** Concrete → Pictorial → Abstract (CPA)
- **Bar models:** Visual representation of word problems (signature technique)
- **Number bonds:** Part-whole relationships (3 and 4 make 7)
- **Mental math strategies:** Make-10, doubles, near-doubles
- **Mastery-based:** Deep understanding before moving on

### 5. European Standards (UK National Curriculum)

**Source:** UK DfE National Curriculum framework

**Key Stage 1 (Years 1-2, Ages 5-7):**
- Number bonds to 20, place value to 100
- Addition/subtraction facts, multiplication/division introduction
- Fractions: halves and quarters
- Money, time, measurement

**Key Stage 2 (Year 3, Age 7-8):**
- Place value to 1000, add/subtract 3-digit numbers
- Multiplication tables (2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10)
- Fractions: unit fractions, non-unit fractions, ordering
- Time to nearest minute, perimeter, angles

**Key Stage 2 (Year 4-5, Age 8-10):**

## Topic Taxonomy (Cross-Curriculum)

## Skill Prerequisites Graph

Critical for the spaced repetition and "what to teach next" systems:

```
count_forward → add_within_10 → add_within_20 → add_within_100
count_backward → subtract_within_10 → subtract_within_20 → subtract_within_100
place_value_ones_tens → add_within_100 + subtract_within_100
equal_groups → multiplication → times_tables
sharing_equally → division → relationship_to_multiplication
add_within_20 + equal_parts → fractions
```

## Implementation Notes

- **Curriculum selection:** User picks during onboarding (default: Common Core)
- **Cross-curriculum mapping:** All problems tagged with universal topic IDs + curriculum-specific standard IDs
- **Difficulty within topics:** Each topic has 5 difficulty levels (intro → fluency)
- **API source:** Common Standards Project provides free JSON API for US standards
- **Russian Math:** No public API; hand-curated content based on RSM and textbook analysis
