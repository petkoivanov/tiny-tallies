# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-01)

**Core value:** Personalized, AI-guided daily math practice that adapts to each child's level, detects misconceptions, and teaches from first principles.
**Current focus:** Phase 2: Math Engine Core

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 8 (Math Engine Core)
Plan: 1 of 2 in current phase
Status: In Progress
Last activity: 2026-03-01 -- Completed 02-01-PLAN.md (Math Engine Foundation)

Progress: [███░░░░░░░] 15%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 3
- Average duration: 2.3min
- Total execution time: 0.12 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 - Scaffolding & Nav | 2 | 5min | 2.5min |
| 2 - Math Engine Core | 1 | 2min | 2min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (3min), 01-02 (2min), 02-01 (2min)
- Trend: Accelerating

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 8-phase structure derived from 36 requirements across 7 categories
- [Roadmap]: Phase 4 (State) can parallelize with Phases 2-3 (Math Engine) since no dependency
- [01-01]: Types co-located in each slice file using StateCreator generic with AppState
- [01-01]: Type-only circular imports between slices and appStore (erased at compile time)
- [01-01]: SessionAnswer extracted as named type for sessionAnswers array elements
- [01-02]: Module-level SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync() to prevent flash of unstyled content
- [01-02]: headerShown: false globally for immersive feel, custom Header component available
- [01-02]: CommonActions.reset on Results Done button to prevent back-navigation to completed session
- [02-01]: Flat type definitions with no class hierarchies -- pure interfaces and type aliases only
- [02-01]: Skill IDs use dot-delimited format (operation.scope.variant) compatible with Record<string, SkillState>
- [02-01]: Mulberry32 PRNG chosen over external dependency -- 15 lines, sufficient for number selection
- [02-01]: Carry/borrow detection uses column-iteration algorithm covering all digit positions
